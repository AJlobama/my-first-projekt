    <p class="description">Prince Arthas Menethil was born four years before the First War to King Terenas Menethil II. 
      The young prince grew up at a time when the lands of all Azeroth were riddled with war, so he learned the art of 
      war from childhood under Muradin Bronzebeard, brother of the dwarven king Magni. 
      Despite his recklessness and stubbornness, Arthas showed great inclinations: under the auspices of Uther the Lightbringer at the age of 19, 
      he entered the Order of the Knights of the Silver Hand, became a renowned warrior and a popular commander. 
      One of his most famous exploits was defeating the trolls who attacked the elven kingdom of Quel'Thalas.

    Doesn't like when they bow down.Returning from Kalimdor after the defeat of the Burning Legion, 
    Arthas demands to call himself king and decides to recapture his kingdom from the Nathrezim left to rule Lordaeron. However,
    as Arthas continued to slay the paladins, he sensed that his strength had dwindled and began to hear the Lich King's calls, 
    ordering him to return to Northrend immediately. Escaping from the capital with a fight and surviving the assassination
    attempt of the out of control of the Lich King Sylvanas, Arthas sails to the northern continent, where he collides with the forces
    of the naga and blood elves under the command of an old enemy - Prince Kael'Tas - and learns, that they are serving Illidan, who arrived in
    Northrend at the behest of Demon Lord Kil'jaeden to destroy the Frozen Throne as punishment for betraying the Legion. Although his powers continue
    to dwindle due to the damage Illidan inflicted on the Frozen Throne, Arthas leads his army and with the help of the gravelord Anub'arak to 
    the Icecrown Glacier, where the Frozen Throne is located, almost simultaneously with Illidan's forces. ... The undead wins the battle, and Arthas 
    himself defeats Illidan in a duel, after which he breaks Ner'zhul's dungeon and becomes a single entity with the Lich King.
